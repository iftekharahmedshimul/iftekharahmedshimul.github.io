# I am on the job market!
# About me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I finished my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology,Bangladesh in 2007 and after working in the industry for 4 years, started my Ph.D. at OSU. Here at OSU I am in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research group. My research focus is on software engineering in general and combining software testing, analysis and data mining to come up with better tools and techniques in particular. I am advised by Carlos Jensen.
