 <h3>  Academic Dishonesty </h3>
<blockquote>
I encourage students to work together and learn from one another on assignments.  However, I do expect you to turn in your OWN work.
Working with someone does not include copying someone else's work and changing a small amount of that work, such as variable names, comments,
spacing, etc.  During group assignments you and your partners may turn in one assignment per group with everyone's name attached.  Working
together is discouraged on exams and the final. At NO point should you copy work from the internet, and if you do copy material
from an external resource, then you need to cite the resource and author(s).  Cheating and plagerisim are not taken lightly! You will receive
a zero on your first abuse of these rules.  In the case of sharedf work, the student sharing the work and the student copying the work will both
recieve zeros.  On the second abuse, your name(s) will be given to the EECS department, where they will handle the details.  Please
read the <a href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/undergraduate/cs/dishonesty.html">department</a>,
<a href="http://engr.oregonstate.edu/students/advising/policy.html">college</a>, and
<a href="http://catalog.oregonstate.edu/ChapterDetail.aspx?key=75#Section2883">university</a> dishonesty policies.
 </blockquote>

<h3>  Students with Disabilities </h3>
 <blockquote>
 "Accommodations are collaborative efforts between students, faculty and Disability Access Services (DAS). Students with accommodations
 approved through DAS are responsible for contacting the faculty member in charge of the course prior to or during the first week of the
 term to discuss accommodations. Students who believe they are eligible for accommodations but who have not yet obtained approval through
 DAS should contact DAS immediately at (541) 737-4098." <p>
 Students with documented disabilities who may need accommodations, who have any
emergency medical information the instructor should be aware of, or who need special
arrangements in the event of evacuation, should make an appointment with the instructor
as early as possible, and no later than the first week of the term. Class materials will be
made available in an accessible format upon request.
