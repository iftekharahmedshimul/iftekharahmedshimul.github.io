        <h1>HW 5 (team): User Stories and Set-up Assignment</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this homework, you will use an Agile method to start planning your system.
        </p>
        <p>Perform the following for this homework
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Meet with the customer to develop 10-20 user stories</li>
            <li>As a team, break the user stories into tasks. Decide which tasks will be easier or harder to implement, and estimate effort</li>
            <li>Meet with the customer to prioritize user stories into three groups: the stories that you will implement this week, the stories that you will implement next week, and the stories that you will probably not have time to implement at all. Note to the customer: be reasonable. If the team says that you're asking too much, then you're probably asking too much!</li>
            <li>Plan how your team will tackle the tasks that are due July 31st to August 5th</li>
            <li>Perform a spike for any user stories that seem especially risky</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You must turn in a PDF document containing the following parts:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Describe your 10-20 user stories (approx 2 pages)</li>
            <li>For each user story, indicate when the story is due (if at all) and list the corresponding tasks. For each task, indicate if you think that it logically should be completed before or after another task. In addition, how long you think that it would take a pair of programmers, working together, to complete the task. (approx 2 pages)</li>
            <li>For each user story due next week, either give a UML sequence diagram showing what your implementation will look like, or describe a spike that you did in order to learn about how to implement the user story (approx 3 pages)</li>
            <li>Outline your plan for implementing the stories due next week -- who is doing what, when? (approx 1 page)</li>
            <li>In one sentence, briefly summarize whether your customer was willing and able to meet with you.  Also, indicate if you think that the customer was reasonable about what will be due on Tuesday. If your customer cannot meet with you on those days, then assign one of your teammates to play the role of the customer.</li>
            <li>Briefly summarize the contribution of each of your team members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some comments</h2>

        <p>Your work will be graded based on whether the content of your PDF appears to be unambiguous, clear, and complete. The page estimates above total 8 pages, but you may turn in up to 15 pages at your discretion.
        </p>

        <p>You can divide this work however you like among your team, but here is a suggested approach that would complete the assignment very efficiently...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wednesday, meet with the customer to develop user stories, which are sent by email to everybody.</li>
            <li>Thursday, the entire team meets to identify tasks, then decide their difficulty and logical ordering.</li>
            <li>Friday, half the team meets with the customer to negotiate what will be completed this week and what will be completed next week. Email results to everybody on team.</li>
            <li>Friday (simultaneously), the other half of the team gets the development environment set up. Send an email to the team telling any special things that they should be aware of.</li>
            <li>Friday, all members of the team either do spikes or write up UML sequence diagrams; email results to the team.
            <li>Saturday, wrap up the PDF document.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>Your homework must be submitted as PDF files and emailed to me (<a href="mailto:ahmed@eecs.oregonstate.edu">ahmed@eecs.oregonstate.edu</a>) no later than 11:59PM, August 5th, 2013.  Late submissions will incur a penalty of 10 points (out of 100) per day.
