            <li>For each user story due today, answer the following (total for all user stories due today, approx 2 pages):
            <ul>
                <li>Which pair(s) of teammates worked on that user story's tasks?</li>
                <li>What do the relevant unit tests do?</li>
                <li>What problems, if any, did you encounter?</li>
                <li>How long did each task require?</li>
                <li>What is the current status (implemented? tested?)</li>
                <li>What is left to be completed?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For each spike and UML sequence diagram that you developed this week, answer the following (total, approx 1/2 page):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Was the spike or diagram useful? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>Were there any diagrams that you wish that you had? Why or why not? (approx 1 page)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Briefly describe any refactoring that you did (approx 1 page)</li>
            <li>If you had to ask the customer any questions, indicate what those questions were and what the customer's response was. Briefly describe any surprises or requirement changes that you encountered. (If your customer does not answer your question within 24 hours, then note this and proceed as best as you can.) (approx 1/2 page)</li>
            <li>Briefly describe all integration tests that you did on the system, the test results, and any changes that you made (or will make) to the system as a result. (When you do these tests, don't be soft. Do a good job -- your goal is to build an awesome system!) (approx 2 pages)</li>
            <li>What is your new schedule for what to complete next week? What user stories will be done, what is your time estimate for each of these user stories? (approx 1 page)</li>
            <li>In one sentence, briefly summarize whether your customer was willing and able to talk with you by email in a timely fashion. If you do not receive a response within 24 hours, proceed as best as you can without customer input.</li>
            <li>Briefly summarize the contribution of each of your team members.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In addition to the PDF, for this homework only, you will need to make an in-class presentation on the last day of class. One or more of your teammates (your team's choice) will use PowerPoint to give this 20-25 minute presentation. The presentation must cover the following:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>An overview of the user stories.</li>
            <li>An overview of your system.</li>
            <li>A demonstration of your system.</li>
            <li>An overview of your experiences developing the system  including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Did you like pair programming? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>What problems, surprises, or requirement changes did you encounter?</li>
                <li>What schedule changes occurred?</li>
				<li>Provide a Burndown diagram </li>
            </ul>
            <li>A consideration of the strengths/weaknesses of Agile vs waterfall including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>What problems did you encounter with Agile methods that you might have avoided with a waterfall-like process?</li>
                <li>What problems did you encounter in the waterfall project earlier this term that you might have avoided with a more Agile process? Share one or two team members' experiences here.</li>
                <li>Looking back on this project, what would you have done differently?</li>
                <li>Looking forward to your future, which parts of Agile and waterfall processes are you likely to use and why?</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some comments</h2>

        <p>Your work will be graded based on whether the content of your PDF appears to be unambiguous, clear, and complete. The page estimates above total 8 pages, but you may turn in up to 15 pages at your discretion.
        </p>

        <p>You can divide this work however you like among your team, but you did come up with a plan on HW 5...just saying.
        </p>
