        <h1>HW 2 (team): Evaluating Requirements Assignment</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this assignment, your team will evaluate the requirements that you produced for HW1.
        </p>
        
        <p>Create paper prototypes for the user interfaces needed in the use cases that you described in HW1. Second, meet with your customer. Bring your requirements definition (from HW1) and your paper prototypes to the meeting. Validate your requirements definition by reviewing it with the customer. Then, test your prototype. Update your requirements definition based on the customer's feedback.
        </p>

        <p>You must turn in a PDF document containing the following parts:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Photographs (or scans) of the most important paper prototypes (approx 6 pages)</li>
            <li>A revised requirements definition (containing all the parts identified in HW1, approx 5 pages)
</li>
            <li>A revised requirements specification (containing all the parts identified in HW1, approx 5 pages)
</li>
            <li>A 2-page summary of what changes were made to the definition and specification, and why</li>
            <li>Brief summary of whether your customer was willing and able to meet on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. If your customer cannot meet with you on those days, then assign one of your teammates to play the role of the customer. (This teammate should do a realistic job! Don't get soft on your teammates--remember that you're trying to design an awesome system here!)</li>
            <li>Briefly summarize the contribution of each of your team members.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some comments</h2>

        <p>Your work will be graded based on whether you appear to have done a thorough job of producing valid, verified requirements. The page estimates above total 18 pages, if you decide to do all parts, but you may turn in up to 25 pages at your discretion.
        </p>

        <p>You can divide this work however you like among your team, but here is a suggested approach that would complete the assignment very efficiently...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wednesday, three team members meet to create the paper prototypes. They email photographs of their prototypes to the entire team.</li>
            <li>Thursday, the entire team meets with the customer to validate the requirements and test the prototypes.</li>
            <li>Friday, one person updates the use cases and charts, one person updates the ERD, one person updates the dataflow diagram, and one person updates the English descriptions; each of these people provide a few paragraphs discussing the changes that they made. They email their work to the entire team.</li>
            <li>Saturday, one team member edits all of the documents together so that they are consistent.</li>
        </ul>
