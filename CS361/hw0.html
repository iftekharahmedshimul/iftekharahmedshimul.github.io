        <h1>HW 0: Vision Statement Assignment</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Your Vision Statement is a document describing a software system that you believe would improve our world. Your Vision Statement can focus on any major world problem that you like. Examples include pollution, poverty, terrorism, fascism, disease, natural disasters, racism, etc.
Your Vision Statement can describe any kind of system that you believe would help to solve some aspect of that problem. For example, if you decide to focus on poverty, you might propose a "web spider" system that sifts through millions of websites looking for the contact information of job training centers, then presents that information in a categorized fashion on a searchable map. (That way, poor people could use a web browser at a public library to look up job centers where they can get some training.)
        </p>

        <p>All the students will get to vote on which Vision Statements would be most interesting to use for class projects this term, and the authors of the most popular Vision Statements will receive extra credit and get to be the "customer" for a team who designs the envisioned system. Note that this means all vision statements will be publicly posted on a website. So only put stuff in the vision if it's ok for the world to read it.
        </p>

        <p>You will never have to actually implement your proposed system. So dream big! But on the other hand, you need to imagine a system that probably could be built, if you had infinite time and money. So don't propose a system that works based on "magic." You need to have at least some idea of how the system might be constructed. Remember that if you propose a system that can't possibly be designed, then nobody is going to vote for your idea.
        </p>


        <h2>Vision Statement Requirements</h2>
        <p>Your vision statement must contain the following parts (for HW 0): 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A title</li>
            <li>What problem are you concerned about?</li>
            <li>Give at least one statistic and one quote that shows it is a major problem.  Make sure to cite your sources.</li>
            <li>Within this world problem, what is one subproblem that bothers you?</li>
            <li>Explain this subproblem in more detail and give a hypothetical example.</li>
            <li>Give one sentence describing a software system that could help to solve this problem.</li>
            <li>Describe three features or parts to your software system.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>You don't need to fill in the entire vision statement during the first week.  Click <a href="http://experiments.eecs.oregonstate.edu/general/visions/">here</a> to see what previous classes did.  I'm expecting something equivalent to the "Short" version of the vision statements for this assignment.  Note that you will not be using this system to create/edit your vision statements.
        </p>
        
        <p>But by the end of the term, you should have completed all sections of your entire vision statement. At the end of the term, I will assign your vision statement a grade. This vision statement grade will count for 8% of your overall course grade. Here is how I will grade your vision statement at the end of the term:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>20 points: does the vision statement demonstrate knowledge about a world problem?</li>
            <li>20 points: does the vision statement demonstrate critical thinking in terms of proposing a solution for the stated problem?</li>
            <li>20 points: does the vision statement include all of the required sections?</li>
            <li>20 points: does the vision statement provide a reference for all quotes, images, and other materials borrowed from elsewhere?</li>
            <li>20 points: does the vision statement contain 2000 words or more?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note that the grading is IN ADDITION TO extra credit awarded for vision statements that students select for project work.</p>
        
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>Your vision statements must be submitted as PDF files and emailed to me (<a href="mailto:ahmed@eecs.oregonstate.edu">ahmed@eecs.oregonstate.edu</a>) no later than 11:59PM, June 28th, 2013.  Late submissions will incur a penalty of 10 pts in the final grade for the vision statement.
